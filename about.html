      <p>
        Hello I am <i>Andrew Valdez</i>, I go to <i>Cal Poly Pomona</i> and
        majoring in Computer Science. I am currently a third-year in Fall 2023.
        I plan to take my masters in Cal Poly Pomona but I still continue to
        think of possible other locations.

      <summary><b>What is my Experience?</b></summary>
      <p>
        I have experience in languages such as Java, Javascript, Typescript,
        Python and C. In terms of programs, I have touched upon and used Next.js
        and React.
      </p>

      <p>
        I have taken part in a team to develop a website for Cal Poly Pomona
        Circle K International. The website was first designed in Javascript and
        used React. Around Spring 2023, the website was restarted to make use of
        Next.js and Typescript and is still currently in development.

      <summary><b>What are my Plans for the Future?</b></summary>

      <p>
        At the current moment, I am looking into Data Science and Neural
        Networks as a possible career choice. I am practicing Python and Jupyter
        Notebooks since the beginning of Summer 2023. I am also taking online
        courses to see if this is a good choice for me in the future.

      <summary><b>How am I progressing towards my goals?</b></summary>

      <p>
        Data Science seems to be a an interesting field that could pay off in
        the long run. As addressed before that I have only started recently to
        be able to get used to it. Certifications are acting as a good starting
        point as I plan to look for possible internships or new projects to work
        on. Such as possible dataset projects on a website known as
        <b>Kaggle</b> (a data science website containing many projects and
        datasets to use)
      </p>

      <p>
        As my semester progresses, I plan to revamp this website to slowly be
        more responsive. Essentially making it more modern but not too advanced
        as this will act as my professional website and portfolio in the future.
        Once I build up my portfolio of course.
