    <h3>What are my Plans for the Future?</h3>

    <p>
      At the current moment, I am looking into Data Science and Neural Networks
      as a possible career choice. I am practicing Python and Jupyter Notebooks
      since the beginning of Summer 2023. I am also taking online courses to see
      if this is a good choice for me in the future.
